    <h2>THE PASTA</h2>
<p>
    My favorite pasta to use for this is penne! However, you can really use 
    any pasta shape you like. Here are just some options I would go for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>rigatoni</li>
    <li>cellentani</li>
    <li>rotini</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Just boil the pasta to al dente or a minute past al dente according to 
    package directions in salted water.
</p>
<p>
Reserve half a cup of pasta water and then drain the pasta once cooked and 
thatâ€™s it! I like to boil the pasta as I start working on the sauce so 
everything is done at the same time.

<h2>
    THE PUMPKIN SAUCE
</h2>
<p>
    If you are hesitant to try this recipe because you can only imagine 
    pumpkin puree in your pumpkin spice latte and not in pasta, think again! 
    I think I might like pumpkin in savory dishes over sweet ones now just 
    because of this one recipe.
</p>
<h5>
    HERE IS EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR THE SAUCE:
</h5>
<ul>
    <li>unsalted butter</li>

<h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
<ul>
    <li>16 ounces penne pasta or rigatoni</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fresh garlic, finely minced</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 cup pumpkin puree</li>
    <li>1 cup half and half or heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan, more to taste</li>
    <li>3 to 4 leaves sage, chopped</li>
    <li>1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup reserved pasta water</li>
</ul>
<h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Throw in the pasta and 
        cook according to package directions. Reserve at least 1/2 cup of 
        pasta water and then drain.</li>
    <li>In a saucepan, add the butter and olive oil over medium heat. Allow 
        the butter to toast and brown and then add the garlic and tomato 
        paste. Cook for about 4 to 5 minutes. The tomato paste will darken in 
        color from a bright red to reddish brown.</li>
    <li>Add the pumpkin puree and mix together. Cook down the pumpkin puree 
        for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the heavy cream and mix until incorporated. Simmer for about 
        2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the reserved pasta water and whisk together to thin out the 
        sauce.</li>
    <li>Finally, add the grated parmesan, sage, red pepper flakes, paprika, 
        nutmeg, onion powder, salt, and black pepper. Mix into the sauce, 
        taste, and adjust anything to your taste.</li>
    <li>Toss in the cooked pasta and mix to coat evenly.</li>
    <li>Serve with more parmesan on top!</li>

    <h5>TIPS & NOTES</h5>
    <p>
        This is optional but highly recommended. Adding a sprinkle of brown 
        sugar to the pumpkin puree brings out the pumpkin flavor even more!
