                <h1>Ice Cream</h1>
                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk 
                        or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, 
                        either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as 
                        cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries 
                        or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in 
                        addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below 
                        the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate 
                        air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from 
                        forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured c
                        ream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is 
                        a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low 
                        temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more 
                        malleable as its temperature increases.

                        Ice cream may be served in dishes, eaten with a spoon, 
                        or licked from edible wafer ice cream cones held by 
                        the hands as finger food. Ice cream may be served with 
                        other desserts—such as cake or pie—or used as an 
                        ingredient in cold dishes—like ice cream floats, 
                        sundaes, milkshakes, and ice cream cakes—or in baked 
                        items such as Baked Alaska.

                    <h3>Different Types</h3>
                    <p>
                        Italian ice cream is gelato. Frozen custard is a type 
                        of rich ice cream. Soft serve is softer and is often 
                        served at amusement parks and fast-food restaurants 
                        in the United States. Ice creams made from cow's milk 
                        alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk 
                        substitutes (e.g., soy, oat, cashew, coconut, almond 
                        milk, or tofu), are available for those who are 
                        lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or 
                        vegan. Banana "nice cream"[a] is a 100% fruit-based 
                        vegan alternative. Frozen yoghurt, or "froyo", is 
                        similar to ice cream but uses yoghurt and can be lower 
                        in fat. Fruity sorbets or sherbets are not ice creams 
                        but are often available in ice cream shops.

                    <h3>Meaning</h3>
                    <p>
                        The meaning of the name ice cream varies from one 
                        country to another. In some countries, such as the 
                        United States and the United Kingdom,[1][2] ice cream 
                        applies only to a specific variety, and most 
                        governments regulate the commercial use of the various 
                        terms according to the relative quantities of the 
                        main ingredients, notably the amount of cream.[3] 
                        Products that do not meet the criteria to be called 
                        ice cream are sometimes labelled "frozen dairy 
                        dessert" instead.[4] In other countries, such as 
                        Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants.

                    The origins of frozen desserts are obscure, although 
                    several accounts exist about their history. Some sources 
                    say the history of ice cream begins in Persia in 550 BC.
                    [5][6][7] A Roman cookbook dating back to the 1st century 
                    includes recipes for sweet desserts that are sprinkled 
                    with snow,[8] and there are Persian records from the 2nd 
                    century for sweetened drinks chilled with ice.[8] Kakigōri 
                    is a Japanese dessert made with ice and flavoured syrup. 
                    The origins of kakigōri date back to the Heian period in 
                    Japanese history, when blocks of ice saved during the 
                    colder months would be shaved and served with sweet syrup 
                    to the Japanese aristocracy during the summer.[9] 
                    Kakigōri's origin is referred to in The Pillow Book, a 
                    book of observations written by Sei Shōnagon, who served 
                    the Imperial Court during the Heian period.[10][11]

                <h3>Early Frozen Desserts</h3>
                <p>
                    The earliest known written process to artificially make 
                    ice is known not from culinary texts, but the 13th-century 
                    writings of Syrian historian Ibn Abi Usaybi'a in his book 
                    "Kitab Uyun al-anba fi tabaqat-al-atibba" (Book of Sources 
                    of Information on the Classes of Physicians) concerning 
                    medicine in which Ibn Abi Usaybi'a attributes the process 
                    to an even older author, Ibn Bakhtawayhi, of whom nothing 
                    is known.[12]

                <h3>Early Modern</h3>
                <p>
                    In the 16th century, the Mughal Empire used relays of 
                    horsemen to bring ice from the Hindu Kush to its capital, 
                    Delhi, used to create kulfi, a popular frozen dairy 
                    dessert from the Indian subcontinent often described as 
                    traditional Indian ice cream.
